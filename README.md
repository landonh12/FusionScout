This is an app created by Landon Haugh of Team Fusion 364 for use in the 2016 FRC Game FIRST Stronghold. It will be used at the 2016 FRC World Championship in St. Louis, MO.

# Notes
This is probably the crappiest hack-job of an app ever. It sucked and I don't know if I'll improve it. It was more of a learning experience than anything.
